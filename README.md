# Voting App

This repository contains a simple voting application built with Solidity, a programming language for smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.

## About the Application

This application allows users to:

- **Create a Ballot:** A user can create a ballot with a title, description, and list of options or candidates.
- **Set Voting Period:** The user can specify a start and end date and time for the voting period.
- **Vote:** Any user can cast their vote for one option or candidate in a ballot.
- **View Results:** Once the voting period is over, anyone can view the total votes for each option and the winner(s) based on the election rules.

### Features

- **Transparency:** All votes are stored on the Ethereum blockchain, ensuring transparency and immutability.
- **Security:** Votes are encrypted and cannot be tampered with.
- **Accessibility:** Anyone with an Ethereum wallet can participate in the voting process.
- **Auditability:** The voting process is auditable by anyone, increasing trust and accountability.

### Technologies

- **Solidity:** Programming language for smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.
- **Hardhat:** Development environment for building, testing, and deploying smart contracts.
- **OpenZeppelin Contracts:** Library of secure and tested smart contract components.

## Prerequisites
